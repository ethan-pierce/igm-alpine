1. Fast case needs slower vel. in lower main stem by about 50%
2. Slow case needs ~100 m less ice thickness
2. Why is sliding velocity ever > surface velocity?
3. Use STD(residual) and plan-view residual plots to verify.
4. Ice thickness --> effective pressure
5. Sliding velocity --> basal melt rate
