1. Increase thickness regularization within [0.1, 1.0].
2. Check the histogram of surface velocity misfit for points where Us > median
3. Check the percent area where Ub > Ubar
4. Plot the histograms of effective pressure and sliding velocity
5. Plot maps of Iverson entrainment depth and basal melt rate
